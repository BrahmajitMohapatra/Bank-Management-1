# Bank-Management

A Bank Management software is essentially a software which can undertake simple banking operations. 
In earlier times before the advent of computers, Banks did exist but everything from maintaining records to computing lengthy and complex calculations was done manually. It had several inherent disadvantages, It not only required large manpower and efficient workers but also very slow and error prone. 
However in recent times everything is done with the help of computers. There are a variety of software available today which can do this task efficiently, fast and accurately without requiring almost any sort of manual labour.
This software also aims to do the same.
